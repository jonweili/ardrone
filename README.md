# Autonomous flight with ROS and AR Drone

I created this package to try out principles from the course Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots on EDx from TUM (http://wiki.ros.org/tum_ardrone).

I'm trying to use and modify the code from the assignments, to make the AR Drone fly a trajectory using marker detection and EKF, both on the real AR Drone and in the Gazebo simulator (http://wiki.ros.org/tum_simulator).
* The real AR Drone uses built in tag detection
* The simulator 'detects' gazebo models named 'marker' as prefix
